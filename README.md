## Developers at Gitcoin

Developers have always been the heart of the Gitcoin ecosystem, ever since our

## Building on Gitcoin's Protocols

### Passport

Passport is a secure and decentralized method for users to prove their identity.
It is used by communities to prevent Sybil attacks, spam, and bots. You can read
more about Passport [here](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/intro-to-passport) or
watch an intro video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGYixVLwzrw).

### Grants Protocol

Gitcoin Grants has been our flagship offering and we're excited to announce that
[it's evolving](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/introduction-to-grants-protocol):
over the next few months, we will be rolling out a fully decentralized protocol,
currently [in alpha](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-alpha-round).

This protocol will give developers and communities the tools to fund their
shared needs.

You can check back here as we launch the protocol and a suite of tools for
building on top of it. We also [invite contributors](#contributing-to-gitcoin)
to help us in our mission to fund public goods.
